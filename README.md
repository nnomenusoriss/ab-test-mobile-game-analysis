# A/B Test Analysis – Mobile Game Onboarding Feature

## Objective
Evaluate the impact of a new onboarding + starter offer feature on early user engagement and monetization performance.

## Experiment Setup
- 6,000 users randomly assigned to:
  - Control Group (old onboarding)
  - Variant Group (new onboarding + starter offer)
- Key Metrics:
  - D7 Retention
  - Purchase Conversion
  - ARPU
  - Revenue statistical significance

> **Note:** This dataset is simulated for demonstration purposes.

## Results

### D7 Retention
- Control: 38.3%
- Variant: 44.1%
- Retention Lift: +15.12%
- Statistical significance: p < 0.001

The retention uplift is statistically significant, indicating the new onboarding meaningfully improves early engagement.

### Monetization
- Control ARPU: 4.64
- Variant ARPU: 5.30
- Revenue Lift: +14.18%
- Revenue p-value: 0.066

While ARPU increased in the Variant group, the uplift is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Additional sample size may be required to validate long-term monetization impact.

---

## Conclusion
The Variant significantly improves early retention and shows promising monetization uplift. 

**Recommendation:** Roll out the new onboarding feature while continuing to monitor revenue performance with larger sample size.
